# Portfolio Site for Kylie Williams

This project serves as a showcase of the many art pieces Kylie has created over her career.  The style and structure of the project is similar to my own portfolio site found at https://github.com/ReactorDevelopment/PortfolioSite/.

### Libraries Used

This project is composed primarily with *React.js* and JavaScript XML (JSX).
*JQuerry* and *W3CSS* are also used to aid in the functionality and styling

### Execution

Running `npm start` in the project's home directory will launch the server on port 5000.

## Hosting and SaaS

The current domain of the site can be found here, at http://174.129.214.82:5000/.

The server is hosted on an AWS Lightsail instance. The repository I use for assets such as the images or documents is AWS S3.
